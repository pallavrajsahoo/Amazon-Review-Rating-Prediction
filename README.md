# Amazon-Review-Rating-Prediction
The project deals with the analysis of customer reviews on eCommerce platforms, specifically for consumer electronics. The objective is to build an end-to-end Machine Learning model that predicts review ratings based on review contents and metadata. We have identified a dataset of 100,000 Amazon product reviews that can be used for model training and then need to deploy the model to an endpoint.
