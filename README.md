# Amazon-Review-Rating-Prediction
The project deals with the analysis of customer reviews on eCommerce platforms, specifically for consumer electronics. The objective is to build an end-to-end Machine Learning model that predicts review ratings based on review contents and metadata. We have identified a dataset of 100,000 Amazon product reviews that can be used for model training and then need to deploy the model to an endpoint.

The project will cover the standard Machine Learning Pipeline of:

    1.  Dataset Overview
    2.  Part A: Data Preprocessing
    3.  Part B: Exploratory Data Analysis
    4.  Part C: Feature Construction
    5.  Part D: Model Training and Evaluation
    6.  Part E: Model Deployment

This Machine Learning end-to-end project consists of the following tasks:

    1. Performed Text data processing and EDA on review texts to remove noise and handle imbalanced data and outliers
    2. Constructed numerical features for prediction by implementing frequency-based features like TF and TF-IDF
    3. Implemented, trained and evaluated various Machine Learning algorithms like Logistic regression, SVM and Random Forest. 
    4. Achieved accuracy of ~82% and deployed the trained model to a public API endpoint on Azure ML Studio
